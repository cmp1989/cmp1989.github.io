        <h2>About the League</h2>
        <p>
          Redline Racing Alliance is a community of both wheel and controller, sim and arcade, racers running structured seasons in
          <strong>NASCAR ’25</strong> on PC. We focus on clean driving, clear communication and a relaxed,
          drama-free atmosphere so everyone can enjoy close racing and strong community.
        </p>
        <p>
          We run multiple series so drivers of all skill levels can find a home – from newcomers to veterans.
          If you like organized racing with a friendly group that still takes the racing seriously, you’re in
          the right place.

          <h3>Non-League Community Events</h3>
          <p>
            Event nights that are for all drivers to come and relax, have a less competetive environment, and feel welcome without the pressure.
            Some nights will focus around racing, and sometimes we'll implement non-racing party-game type nights.
