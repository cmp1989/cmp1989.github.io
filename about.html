      <section class="card">
        <p>
          Redline Racing Alliance was created after the largest Heat 5 league remaining on PC made their
          transition into the new game that iRacing released in Fall of 2025: NASCAR '25.<br><br>
          A group of passionate racers who wanted more structured and professional NASCAR ’25 league
          racing without some of the more negative vibe that sometimes comes with competetion transitioned into
          this new game with the goal being a perfect balance of a vibrant, community environment and solid, competetive racing.<br><br>
          Our goal is to combine serious on-track competition with a relaxed, respectful community off the track.
          We will not only run league races, some of which will be by try-out only, but will also
          hold community events (racing and non-racing) on non-league race days/times that will be open to ALL skill level
          and will not require any form of commmittment or registration.<br><br>Our events emphasize clean driving, awareness and
          communication. Mistakes happen – intent and attitude matter most.<br><br>
          <strong>Just show up!</strong>
        </p>

          <i><strong>(NOTE: We race exclusively on PC using NASCAR ’25.)</strong></i>
